# M-Theory
Sane boilerplate for wrangling notes, chords, and tuning.

I find myself writing the same boilerplate (or just giving up) whenever I find myself needing some music notation data structures.
BUT NO LONGER!

Done:
- Fundamental Note Structure

TODO:
- Transposition algebra
- Chord-finder/representation/parsing
- More midi interop
